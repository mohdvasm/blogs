**Machine Learning (ML)** is a core branch of Artificial Intelligence where computers learn from data — instead of being explicitly programmed.

## 🧠 What is Machine Learning?

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a core branch of Artificial Intelligence where computers learn from data — instead of being explicitly programmed.

In simple terms, machine learning is about building systems that **improve over time** as they see more examples.

Think:
📊 *Data in → Patterns learned → Predictions or decisions out*

### 🔍 Why Machine Learning Matters

From recommending your next movie to detecting fraud, ML is everywhere. It's the backbone of:

* Personalized content (Netflix, Spotify)
* Voice assistants (Siri, Alexa)
* Medical diagnostics
* Self-driving cars
* Stock market predictions

### 🧩 Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**
   Learn from labeled data (e.g., house prices, spam emails)
   📦 Examples: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines

2. **Unsupervised Learning**
   Find hidden patterns in unlabeled data
   🧠 Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)

3. **Reinforcement Learning**
   Learn by trial and error through rewards
   🕹️ Used in: Robotics, game AI, resource optimization
